# SVideo + Composite: Filter / Amplifier

This project makes up a small PCB that you can embed into pretty much any Retro system that uses CHROMA + LUMA (Svideo) to create its output. This amp can be configured to filter, or filter and amplify the signal - and it will also generate a perfectly in-spec CVBS (Composite) signal without injecting any interference onto the other signals. 

The PCB uses the FMS6400 IC at U1 - and while these are older and out of production, there are many to be had on eBay or AliExpress.

Datasheet for the IC: https://static6.arrow.com/aropdfconversion/7fe50da04e1ba81a06ef8d061fd01bb64574320b/fms6400.pdf

You need +5v and LUMA and CHROMA that are somwhere in the ballpark of correctly generated. This board will take those signals and spit out filtered / corrected signals that can be sent on to a TV or Projector, most anything that accepts SVideo or Composite.

Have fun!
