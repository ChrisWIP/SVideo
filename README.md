SVideo + Composite Filter Amplifier - a Retro computer signal handler

This project makes up a small PCB that you can embed into pretty much any Retro system that uses CHROMA + LUMA (Svideo) to create its output. This amp can be configured to filter, or filter and amplify the signal - and it will also generate a perfectly in-spec COMPosite signal without placing any interference onto the other signals. 

The PCB uses the FMS6400 IC at U1 - and while these are older and out of production, there are many to be had on eBay or AliExpress.
